# 👋 Hi, I’m Jahswill Ovedhe

Welcome to my GitHub! I’m a Senior DevOps Engineer with extensive experience in cloud infrastructure, automation, and software engineering.

## 👀 About Me

I’m passionate about **DevOps Engineering**, **Cloud Engineering**, and **Software Engineering**. With 6+ years of experience, I specialize in designing, deploying, and managing highly scalable cloud solutions. I have hands-on expertise in AWS, GCP, Docker, Kubernetes, and a variety of IaC tools, including **Terraform**, **CloudFormation**, and **Ansible**.

### 🌱 What I Do
- Architect and provision **scalable cloud infrastructures** using **AWS** (5X certified) and **GCP**.
- Deploy and manage containerized applications with **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, and **ECS**.
- Implement **CI/CD pipelines** for automation and efficient software delivery using **Jenkins**, **GitLab CI/CD**, **ArgoCD**, and **CircleCI**.
- Leverage **Terraform**, **CloudFormation**, and **Ansible** for infrastructure as code (IaC) to ensure repeatable, scalable, and secure cloud environments.
- Design and develop **serverless applications** using **AWS Lambda** and **Python**.
- Optimize cloud costs, system performance, and ensure system reliability with modern monitoring tools like **CloudWatch**, **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, and the **ELK Stack**.

### 💞️ I'm Looking To Collaborate On:
- **DevOps Automation** and **Cloud Solutions**.
- Building resilient, scalable, and cost-effective **cloud architectures**.
- Collaborating with teams to create seamless **CI/CD pipelines** for smooth software delivery.
